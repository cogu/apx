# APX for C++

The primary purpose of this implementation is to prototype and evaluate new features in APX IDL v1.3 as well as
APX VM 2.0.

It's not yet functioning as a working APX client as it's currently in early phases of development.

In time, this implementation will replace [qt-apx](https://github.com/cogu/qt-apx) implementation as the primary
imlementation of APX for C++.
